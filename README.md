More interesting than hello world.
I love art. I have done quite a bit of art work of my own, unfortunately did not save much of it. Then I went to an online university for my bachelors in fine arts, primarily web design. I tried at freelance well.... But again got a phone call from the university to see if I was interested in getting a masters in information technology. So I went back to school mostly for programming but the possibilities are endless!
